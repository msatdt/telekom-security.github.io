---

A new remote buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the latest version of the SharkSSL library
from 05.05.2024 (https://github.com/RealTimeLogic/SharkSSL) by security evaluators of Deutsche
Telekom Security GmbH and Deutsche Telekom AG with modern fuzzing methods. <!--more-->The vulnerability allows
an attacker to read large regions of the SharkSSL TLS server’s memory. This is likely to result in a
segmentation fault and can be used for a remote Denial-of-Service attack by an attacker.
Special thanks to Robert Hörr for his support, supervision and guidance during this research.
